## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital based on their medical data. The project includes:
- A machine learning model trained on patient data.
- A Flask API to serve predictions.
- A Streamlit dashboard for interactive predictions and visualization.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PatientReadmissionPrediction.git
cd PatientReadmissionPrediction
```
### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```
Install the required libraries:
```bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Download the Dataset
Download the dataset from the UCI Repository or Kaggle.
```
Rename the dataset to diabetes_data.csv.

Place it in the data/ folder.

### Step 4: Train the Model
Run the script to preprocess the data, train the model, and save it:

```bash
Copy
python app/model.py
Step 5: Start the Flask API
Run the Flask app to serve predictions:
```
```bash
Copy
python app/web_service.py
Step 6: Launch the Streamlit Dashboard
Run the Streamlit app for interactive predictions:
```
```bash
Copy
streamlit run dashboard/streamlit_app.py
```
